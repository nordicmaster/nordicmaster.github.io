When the ships on the crushing waves
Lead us on through the morning gates
And hundreads people work entirely
Like the one commandor of fleet

See the great force
Against the sea rage
Master will defend from gale

Storm is raging and the crew is tired
But no one doubts that he is surviving
Because great leader keeps his secrets
And how he struggles Against the tides

See the great force
Against the sea rage
Master will defend from gale

When the path lies far beyound
And the danger is only a nightmare
The crew drinks a barrel with a rum
And hail their commandor of fleet 

Fear the great force
Against the sea rage
To the Master respect forever

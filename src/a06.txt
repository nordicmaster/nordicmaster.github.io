Happy hunting
//AI generated

Oh the sun is shining bright,
And the breeze it feels just right,
In the forest we take delight,
Our hearts fill with pure delight.

Chorus:
Happy hunting we shall go,
With our bows and arrows in tow,
Tracking animals high and low,
Nature's beauty we'll come to know.

The rustling of the leaves,
The chirping of the birds,
We follow where the game leads,
Our sights set, not deterred.

Chorus:
Happy hunting we shall go,
With our bows and arrows in tow,
Tracking animals high and low,
Nature's beauty we'll come to know.

As we seek our target true,
We pause to take in the view,
The great outdoors, so vast and new,
Our gratitude just grows and grows.

Chorus:
Happy hunting we shall go,
With our bows and arrows in tow,
Tracking animals high and low,
Nature's beauty we'll come to know.

So let us all join in this joy,
Of the hunt, and nature's employ,
Our hearts fill with a happy buoy,
As we savor each and every joy.

Chorus:
Happy hunting we shall go,
With our bows and arrows in tow,
Tracking animals high and low,
Nature's beauty we'll come to know.

Lock out of bounds
Look onto clouds
Life over there
Loud as the thunder
Grim and dark as winter night

Verse 1:
I'm standing outside with no way in
Lock out of bounds, lost in the spin
I'm staring up at the sky so blue
With all my dreams, I'm feeling brand new

Chorus:
Look onto clouds, they guide my way
Showing me that I'll find my place
Through the darkness and the doubt
I'll keep reaching out

Verse 2:
I've been knocked down, time and again
Broken and bruised, but I won't give in
I may be locked out, but I'll find the key
Taking hold of my destiny

Chorus:
Look onto clouds, they guide my way
Showing me that I'll find my place
Through the darkness and the doubt
I'll keep reaching out

Bridge:
I'll break down barriers
No mountain too high to climb
I'll chase down my dreams
With all my heart and all my mind

Chorus:
Look onto clouds, they guide my way
Showing me that I'll find my place
Through the darkness and the doubt
I'll keep reaching out 

Outro:
I'm standing tall, no longer lost
With courage and strength, counting the cost
I'll never be locked out of my own fate
The clouds in the sky, they never abate.

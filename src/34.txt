we all waiting for battle
greatest battle on the world
amount of enemies is much more than we thought
they all betrayed our king
and served his bastard son
i pray to gods and hope that battle will be won!

i served my king for many years
before this fight i have no fears
the sound of horns is in my ears
it`s time to kill, it`s time to slay.

the night is coming, light are fade
we are prepare to defend the gate
of our king`s castle - it`s our fate
to win or die - no other way.

for the king we fight!
for the king we die!

we see the flight of arrows
the bringers of quick death
and rocks that smashing into walls and make me take deep breath
but while our castle standing still
we have advantage in a height
but soon they make a hole in wall
or break the gates, and i will fight.

the time has come, and it will fly
so fast like it was flash of light
that shines when barrel with the powder
crushed into the walls.
so memory of battle was 
like i've been drunk - no logic thoughts,
but i fought with rousing force
for victory or death.

for the king we fight!
for the king we die!

so tell me what was battle,
greatest battle on the world?
when legions of the enemies was discarded from our homes.
this siege was greatest wartime act - 
they perished after counterattack
we won this war. so, let`s drink more
and hail our kingdom therefore!

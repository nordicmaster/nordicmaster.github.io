Fury is our heritage
Every time it holding strength
From the fire in our souls
To the storm in our breath

We were born to fight
To rise against the tide
With the fury in our hearts
And the passion in our eyes


We won't back down
We won't give in
We'll break the chains
And let the battle begin

For we are warriors
And this is our land
With fury as our heritage
We'll show them where we stand.


Fury is our heritage
Every time it holding strength
From the fire in our souls
To the storm in our breath

We were born to fight
To rise against the tide
With the fury in our hearts
And the passion in our eyes

Spending time with no concretics,
Life seems too pathetic,
Glad to be misunderstood
Though I`ve done all I could.

No time is still enough
To remake all the stuff.
No way out of deadlock
If there is no one to drag me off.

Microsocial tyranny
Has a great effect on me.
Can I change something
Or just exist as nothing?

The more I get, the more I give
The more I sleep, the more I snore
The more I drink, the more I sway
Never trust the liquor store

The more I run, the more I'm done
The more I sing, the more I swing
The more I eat, the more I'm full
I hate those chicken wings

The more the merrier, that's our way
We are gonna reach it
We've set the sail, we're on our way
And we'll finally reach it

The more the merrier

The more I fly, the more I'm high
The more I come, the more I'm here
The more I see, the more I squint
Against the glowing sun my dear
The more I catch, the more I've got
The more I dive, the more I'm wet
The more I drive, the more I'm gone
A trip you won't regret

The more the merrier, that's our way
We are gonna reach it
We've set the sail, we're on our way
And we'll finally reach it

The more the merrier

The more I breathe, the more I live
The more I stand, the more I'm up
The more I cuss, the more I'm ill
Wanna drink'll in this cup
The more I bounce, the more I bust
The more I'm ailed, the more I fail
The more I hike, the more I walk
Along the happy trails

The more the merrier, that's our way
We are gonna reach it
We've set the sail, we're on our way
And we'll finally reach it

The more, the merrier, more than most
Now we are gonna reach it

We've set the sail, we're on our way
And finally we'll reach it

The more the merrier, that's our way
And we are gonna reach it

The more the merrier

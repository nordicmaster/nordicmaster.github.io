I the Sun ov man
the offspring ov the stellar race
my halo fallen and crushed upon the earth
that I may bring balance to this world

I son ov perdition
from sheer nothingness transgressed
unto the highest self â€“ to utmost freedom
to explore the starry nature ov my rage

I pulse ov existence
the law ov nature undenied
I hold the torch ov Heraclites
so I can shake the earth and move the suns

I divine iconoclast
injecting chaos into my veins
with life accepted
with pain resurrected
is the embrace ov god in man profound

the joy ov a dawn
the ecstasy ov dusk
nourished have I this karmic flow
where great above meets great below
let it be written!
let it be done!
scattered I walk towards
the fractured light

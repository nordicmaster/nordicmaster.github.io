There is Fenris grim
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves
Jormungandr twists and turns, mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate

Thor, Odin's son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, your destiny awaits
Thor, Hlódyn's son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, Ragnarök awaits

Vingthor rise to face the snake with hammer high
at the edge of the world
as lightning fills the air
as Mjöllnir does it's work
the twinfold serpent roars in pain

Thor, Odin's son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, your destiny awaits
Thor, Hlódyn's son, protector of mankind, ride to meet your fate, Ragnarök awaits

Mighty Thor, grabs the snake
firmly by its tongue
lifts his hammer high to strike
soon his work is done

Vingthor slays the guardian snake
leading to the death
twilight of the thundergod
Ragnarök awaits
twilight of the thunder god
twilight of the thunder god
twilight of the thunder god
twilight of the thunder god

Thunder rolls across the plains
Thor rides in pouring rain
He rides to Jotumheim to fight
Lightning strikes when Mj√∂llnir bites

Fire!
Burning in his eyes
Fire!
His rage is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire!
Burning in his eyes
Fire!
His hate is pure, see the lightning strike

Lightning cracks the blackened sky
Hear the thunder chariot ride
All brave men with hearts of war
Ride the path of mighty Thor

Son of thunder, lighting strikes, son of thunder!
Son of thunder, Thor arise, son of thunder!

Son Of Oden
Thundergod
Master of War
Asator!


Fire!
Burning in his eyes
Fire!
His rage is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire!
Burning in his eyes
Fire!
His hate is pure, see the lightning strike

I see the red sea part in front of me.
I see the desert clouds bleed above me.
I'm with the prophets on the final destiny.
We'll fight the heathens and the ghost enemy.

This is the prophecy!
This is the prophecy!

I see the money beggars on the last temptation.
We're marching now through the devastation.
I'm with the prophets on a mission of salvation.
Cities falling, nations falling nations.

This is the prophecy!
This is the prophecy!

I see the new millennium tribal warfare.
I see them blind sheep going nowhere.
The new exodus, just like they said.
I see the crown of thorns, you know I was there.

This is the prophecy!
This is the prophecy!

I see the times in this Armaggideon.
I see the flag of the conquering lion.
I must reach the mountains of Zion.
I'm with the prophets and the prophecy goes on.

This is the prophecy!
This is the prophecy!

New millennium tribal war!
New millennium tribal war!

New millennium tribal war!
New millennium tribal war!

She's roaming free
Tucked with a lifeline
She's haunting me
Rocked by the netherworld

Consciously comes to me
Down her knees
Painfully she moans indeed
Rapidly aggresively
Daggers shine and daggers kill

Nightfall
Chaos alive
Demonic
The wolfpack

Your path is lit
Look for the alpha
Drugged to the bone
In the devils grip

Consciously comes to me
Down her knees
Painfully she moans indeed
Rapidly aggresively
Daggers shine and daggers kill

Nightfall
Chaos alive
Demonic
The wolfpack

Warcraft of the witch
Ceremonial ritual
This is the dream
That came to follow me

Nightfall
Chaos alive
Demonic
The wolfpack

Pick up the fragments and piece them together
Tell me do you like what you've found?
Are your thoughts like the earth spinning round?
Existence is pure pantomime
Why is life such a puzzle sometimes?

Trapped in a world I no longer feel part of
Each day is a thorn in my side
Though I've carried my cross - worn my heart on my sleeve
Still deep inside something has died.
If men have a sell-by-date I've just reached mine
Now we've come to the end of the line.
Why is life such a puzzle sometimes?

Well I just can't believe that it's happened again
Always knew that it would - just a matter of when
A lie was the last straw on this camels back
And just like Lot's wife I could never look back.
So maybe the reason I act so estranged
Is you still dream of him, it's you that has changed.

No method to madness - no reason to rhyme
Now we've come to the end of the line.

From the ancient times
The legend grew. It tells
About the man,
Whose courage and valour were obviously vast.
If you will believe
To sagas containing grief, mirth,
Weakness and energy.

Only he could find
The way among blue tides.
Over the seas
He sailed longer then anyone in the past.
Maybe one will see
Over northern sea
The ship of the Master comes.

The crew contained fair men,
Honest, though they were 
Mercenaries
And fighting has made their swords never rust.
And those who returned
Told the stories of (great)
Nordic Master`s adventures.

the legend grew. It tells
about the man,
whose courage and valour were obviously vast.

Only he could find
The way among blue tides.

ship of the Master comes.

The crew contained fair men,
honest, though they were 
mercenaries
and fighting has made their swords never rust. //check out
And those who returned
told the stories of (great)
Nordic Master`s adventures.

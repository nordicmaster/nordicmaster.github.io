Last crow rose up to the sky
Feast was finished on the
Place where we lived.
Cruel grim slaughter was right here.
Crows are fed all out,
Land is full of blood.
Storm will come here from the west,
Rain will wash away all the trails
And no one will ever know
What was happened with our home.

Burned! Killed and burned!
Our ancestors were burned!
But we will return 
And will build new hope.

Dwellers of this darkest land have no fear;
Beware, evil, because we here.

Hordes of horror creatures
Has risen from their lairs
And attacked unarmed people
When they have not prepered.
The fate divorced settlers
From their defenders
So beasts killed them all
And gone back not for long.

Now we have the time
To prepare to their attack.
Maybe they will die in flames,
Anyway, we`ll take revenge.
Stars will be our witnesses
Or sun, but it`s not likely.
Time will come to slay the creatures -
Evil will not keep this secret.

Burn! They will burn!
Our enemies will burn!
And we will return 
To build a new hope.

Dwellers of this darkest land have no fear;
Beware, evil, because we here.

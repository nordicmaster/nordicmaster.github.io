last crow rose up to the sky
feast was finished on the
place where we lived
cruel grim slaughter was right here
crows are fed all out
land is full of blood
storm will come here from the west
rain will wash away
all the trails 
and no one will ever know
what was happened
with our home

burned! killed and burned!
our ancestors were burned!
but we will return 
and will build new hope.

dwellers of this darkest land have no fear;
beware, evil, because we here.

hordes of horror creatures
has risen from their lairs
and attacked unarmed people
when they have not prepered
the fate divorced settlers
from their defenders
so beasts killed them all
and gone back not for long

now we have the time
to prepare to their attack
maybe they will die in flames
anyway, we`ll take revenge
stars will be our witnesses
or sun, but it`s not likely
time wiil come to slay the creatures
evil will not keep this secret.

burned! they will burned!
our enemies will burned!
and we will return 
to build new hope.

dwellers of this darkest land have no fear;
beware, evil, because we here.

ea!

Riding bike is like sailing on drakkar
Feel of freedom drives me mad
Steel or water are basic elements
Of life and death

Endless plains during the ride
Or sea without shores
Are both irreplaceable
To my heart

I recall that time when I was staying
On the edge of eternal tranquility
One of the way to keep self-possession
Is thinking about this ...

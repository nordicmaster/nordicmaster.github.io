Shelter coming on the way.
Victim`s lot is price to pay.
Social life begins to end.
Against folly none can stand.

Shit is happen all the time.
Country falls, the world is fine
To find shelter is a way
From fine people, back to.. Hey!


Can you live alone,
Restrict yourself and minimize communication?
Storm is going on,
Forbidding things, destroying hanging situation.


To break free is to pretend
That the final work has end.
People count has no limits
This thesis can`t be omitted

Where to go when all is failed
Nothing left but to set sails
Away from land that ill and foul
To the west to unknown.. How?


Can you smell a stench?
From town to town, overpopulated?
Stare at fire rage
When time has gone to be located.

Shelter coming on the way
Victim`s lot is price to pay
Social life begins to end
Against folly none can stand

Shit is happen all the time
Country falls, the world is fine
To find shelter is a way
From fine people, back to.. Hey!


Can you live alone?
Without web, with minimized communication/
Storm is going on
As forbidding thing, destroying hanging situation


To break free is to pretend
that the final work has end
people count has no limits
this thesis can`t be omitted

Where to go when all is failed
Nothing left but to set sails
Away from land that ill and foul
To the west to unknown.. How?


Can you smell a stench?
From town to town, overpopulated/
Stare at fire rage
When time has gone to be located

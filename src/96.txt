Story may change / every point of view / or even worse  
Divide into parts.
Some group of men / has broken because / they haven`t learn 
To reveal the lies.
The purpose is clear / to teach not to fear / but every tale
Check out and review.
I see the prediction / of many unable / to work and together
To build a new communion.

Glory and fame / are set into dignity / where are the truth?
Fairness of many.
To them who wishes / more goods and authority / just for themselves
Think about the others
Who wish just a little / do a favorite things / with no bad thoughts
They deserve the best.
I see the prediction / of many are able / to face themselves
With wishes.

See clear your wishes and stories you hear and events you observe.
Dangerous is desires and harmful is lie.
Whenever you live you shall dream of better life.

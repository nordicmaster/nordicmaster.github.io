I am the lord of darkness and despair
I am the bringer of chaos and death
I am the master of pain and fear
I am the ruler of this world

Hail me, hail me, hail me
Hail the black metal king
Hail me, hail me, hail me
Hail the black metal king

I have the power to destroy and create
I have the wisdom to deceive and manipulate
I have the vision to foresee and dominate
I have the will to conquer and annihilate

Hail me, hail me, hail me
Hail the black metal king
Hail me, hail me, hail me
Hail the black metal king

No one can stop me
No one can resist me
No one can challenge me
No one can defeat me
No one can equal me
No one can surpass me
No one can deny me
No one can oppose me

Hail me, hail me, hail me
Hail the black metal king
Hail me, hail me, hail me
Hail the black metal king

I am the black metal king
I am the black metal king
I am the black metal king
I am the black metal king

when waves of the narrow sea
bump into the board
i feel myself peacefully
in my lower boat.
dreams keep turning in my head
while i lie in hold
and thinking about way
how to spend my gold

many times unfortunate
but one day will bring success

when storm came i didnt hide
trying flow back home
gods of sea could kill me but
they just sank all my gold
such a terrible event
made me fell upset
i felt cold wind in my head
well, i`ve lost even hat.


many times unfortunate
but one day will bring success.
maybe not, the storm will bring
desperation in cold hand.
fortune like an artful hunter
sets her traps in unknown place
so, mortal people look at lure
and follow to the seeming grace

i see raven flying high
over place of crushing
now he know how i survived
was it worth my caches?
anyway, i`m live again
and don`t gonna cry
fortune comes another day
for everyone who tries. 

many times unfortunate
but one day will bring success.
maybe not, the storm will bring
desperation in cold hand.
fortune like an artful hunter
sets her traps in unknown place
so, mortal people look at lure
and follow to the seeming grace

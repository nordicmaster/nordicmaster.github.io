When waves of the narrow sea
Bump into the board,
I feel myself peacefully
In my lower boat.
Dreams keep turning in my head
While I lie in hold
And thinking about way
How to spend my gold.

Many times unfortunate
But one day will bring success

When storm came I didnt hide
Trying flow back home.
Gods of sea could kill me but
They just sank all my gold.
Such a terrible event
Made me fell upset,
I felt cold wind in my head
Well, i`ve lost even hat.

Many times unfortunate
But one day will bring success.
Maybe not, the storm will bring
Desperation in cold hand.
Fortune like an artful hunter
Sets her traps in unknown place.
So, mortal people look at lure
And follow to the seeming grace.

I see raven flying high
Over place of crushing.
Now he know how i survived.
Was it worth my caches?
Anyway, I live again
And don`t gonna cry.
Fortune comes another day
For everyone who tries. 

Many times unfortunate
But one day will bring success.
Maybe not, the storm will bring
Desperation in cold hand.
Fortune like an artful hunter
Sets her traps in unknown place.
So, mortal people look at lure
And follow to the seeming grace.

Go and destroy
All around there,
Claim it for us,
Leave none alive
In the name of god.

Pagan will fall
When wooden icons
And statues will burn;
When people will earn
Mercy from the
GOD OF NORTH arise to war
When south and east will be defeated.
GOD OF NORTH creates a law
And this will be revenge for all.

Kill eastern abomination,
Strike also the black and yellow
And scum from south we shall beat
That spreads like a pest indeed.

Fire will feed upon you all
Fire will feed upon you all

Pagan you are
Christians and jews,
Buddhist and shit.
You will be destroyed
By the mighty
GOD OF NORTH arise to war
When south and east will be defeated.
GOD OF NORTH creates a law
And this will be revenge for all.

The storm is coming.
I have foreboding
That nothing will remain
After that dreadful gale.
We have sailing
On merchant argosy.
Terrible fantasies
Now come to me.

What will be?
Soon I`ll see
Our ship`s rapid 
Sinking

The storm is raging.
The crew is bothering,
They lingered with the ropes
And ship sways without scopes
On blackened waves.
Now we cannot do anything.
And water surging
On the board where I stay.

I can hear
Only wind
In my ears
Blowing

But, wait, what`s coming?
It is the battleship,
Storm makes no harm to him.
At any rate how it seems.
Finally I thudded
In cold dark water,
But something braided me
And pulled out to the ship.

Some will say
It was fate
With my life
Playing

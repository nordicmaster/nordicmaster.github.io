Our future was written
By hands of fate.
Through storms to the north
To victory we sail.

We follow the call of the heart,
To faraway lands.
Cold north invites us
To the viking`s shores

Covered with snow,
Whirlwinds will blow
While we have to go
And say farewell to our home.


Bloodred axe and broken shield
Our people will not yield!
Corpses fall on battlefield
This is enemy`s defeat!

Lord lead us to battle
To tortures and pain,
To wounds and despair
Through fear and hate.

I have to fight
Without mercy
To make foe`s bodies cold
And take their gold.

Treasures and wine
It will be mine!
I will not die
And can not deny it.


Bloodred axe and broken shield
Our people will not yield!
Corpses fall on battlefield
This is enemy`s defeat!

The battle is over! 
Let the vikings celebrate,
Drink and sing
About victory

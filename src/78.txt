Once i was thinking
about world and it`s meaning
how slender our deeds
and something that we heed

Dreams and illusions will be my past,
present, future, the last
Of conciousness,nonetheless,
i`ll do my best
Roaming the world, gathering everything and nothing
Building ruins and breaking laws, mine of course

So the point of being
Will be unknown
forevermore
Restless i live and die
Finally - who am I
Here on this earth? i defy (to be in the dark)

Dreams and illusions will be my past,
present, future, the last
Of conciousness,nonetheless,
i`ll do my best
Roaming the world, gathering everything and nothing
Building ruins and breaking laws, mine of course

Scream of my dark soul
Was the last in the bright world
Beneath the heaven
I cry and hope forever

Dreams and illusions will be my past,
present, future, the last
Of conciousness,nonetheless,
i`ll do my best
Roaming the world, gathering everything and nothing
Thinking of the life it was, mine of course

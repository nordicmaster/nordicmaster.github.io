Once I was thinking
About world and it`s meaning,
How slender our deeds
And something that we heed.

Dreams and illusions will be my past,
Present and future, the last
Of conciousness, nonetheless,
I`ll do my best.
Roaming the world, gathering everything and nothing,
Building ruins and breaking laws, mine of course.

So the point of being
Will be unknown
Forevermore.
Restless I live and die,
Finally - who am I
Here on this earth? I defy (to be in the dark)

Dreams and illusions will be my past,
Present and future, the last
Of conciousness, nonetheless,
I`ll do my best.
Roaming the world, gathering everything and nothing
Building ruins and breaking laws, mine of course

Scream of my dark soul
Was the last in the bright world
Beneath the heaven
I cry and hope forever

Dreams and illusions will be my past,
Present and future, the last
Of conciousness, nonetheless,
I`ll do my best.
Roaming the world, gathering everything and nothing
Thinking of the life it was, mine of course

Story is still going further
Leading me to travel
Wild conquest from the north

Now I see
     Homeland
        Right there
Turning circle
     Around
        The World

I saw deep grey waters
And epic high lands
My journey returns back
To where I stand
Reaching the goals or failing
Not a problem at all
My spirit shall stay there
Where north wind calls //{howls}

For too long
     There was
          My home
Now I see
     Whole world
          In you

And epic high lands
My journey returns back
To where I stand
Reaching the goals or failing
Not a problem at all
My spirit shall stay there
